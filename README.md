# UX

who is it for?
* As a user I want to quickly understand what the game is all about.
* As a user I want to get in a cheerful mood.
* As a user I want to gain something more than just having fun, in this case concentration and memory skills.
* As a user, I want to be able to chose whether I want to listen to the happy game music or not.


## Design

I visually aimed the look for kids. I specifically had my kids in mind when making it with happy, bright and colourful colors and funny looking faces with different moods. The different moods of faces also is a good thing for kids to think about. "Is that face happy or sad?"
