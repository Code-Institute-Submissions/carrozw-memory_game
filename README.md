# UX

Who is it for?
* As a user, I want to quickly understand what the game is all about.
* As a user, I want to get in a cheerful mood.
* As a user, I want to gain something more than just having fun, in this case concentration and memory skills.
* As a user, I want to be able to chose whether I want to listen to the happy game music or not.


## Design / Color scheme

I visually aim the look for kids with the happy, bright and colourful colors. The different moods of the faces is also a good thing for kids to reflect over. "Is that face happy or sad?".
At the same time, it's not too crazy, so even older kids (adults) can stand the look.

## Typography

* I chose Fontdiner Swanky for a more playful feel and sans-serif as a back-up.
